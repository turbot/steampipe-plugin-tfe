# Table: tfe_project - Query Terraform Enterprise Projects using SQL

Terraform Cloud projects let you organize your workspaces into groups. You can structure your projects based on your
organization's resource usage and ownership patterns, such as teams, business units, or services. With Terraform Cloud
Standard Edition, you can give teams access to groups of workspaces using projects.

## Table Usage Guide
The `tfe_project` table provides information about Projects within Terraform Enterprise organization. As a DevOps 
engineer or a system administrator, explore project's details through this table, including its ID, name and organization.
Utilize it in conjunction with `tfe_workspace` table to improve grouping and filtering on workspaces insights.

## Examples

### List projects

Explore which projects are in the Terraform Enterprise organization.

```sql
select
  *
from
  tfe_project;
```

### List workspace in a specific project

Explore which workspaces belong to a specific project. This can provide an additional filtering layer to analyse 
relative workspaces.

```sql
select
    w.name
from
        tfe_workspace as w
    join
        tfe_project as p
    on
        p.id = w.project_id
where p.name ='my-project'
;
```
