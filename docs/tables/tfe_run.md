from
  tfe_run

```sql
select
  id,
  created_at,
  status
from
  tfe_run
where
  workspace_id = 'ws-ocKJU1ouZNZWZoUx'
  and status = 'errored'
  and created_at > current_timestamp - interval '24 hrs'
```

### Which users created the most runs?

```sql
select
  created_by ->> 'Username' as username,
