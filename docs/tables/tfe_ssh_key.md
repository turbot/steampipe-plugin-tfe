# Table: tfe_ssh_key - Query Terraform Enterprise SSH Keys using SQL

Terraform Enterprise is a collaborative, scalable, and enterprise-friendly service offered by HashiCorp that provides workflow and automation control for infrastructure as code (IaC). It supports the management of SSH keys, which are essential for secure server communication and access control. These keys are crucial for the security of your infrastructure, and Terraform Enterprise provides a way to manage and monitor them.

## Table Usage Guide

The `tfe_ssh_key` table provides insights into SSH keys within Terraform Enterprise. As a DevOps engineer, explore key-specific details through this table, including key ID, name, and associated metadata. Utilize it to uncover information about keys, such as their creation and last usage time, which can be crucial for auditing and security purposes.

## Examples

### Basic info
